        <center><h1>Hypnagogia Aid</h1></center>
        <p>Hypnagogia is the transitional state between wakefulness and sleep. During hypnagogia, one can experience visions, sounds, and the fluid association of ideas. Many famous thinkers, including Edison, Dali, Tesla, Newton, Poe, and Nabakov, have credited self-induced hypnagogia with enhancing their creativity.</p>
        <p>Edison famously induced hypnagogia by falling asleep with steel balls in his hands. When he would fall asleep, he would drop the ball waking himself up, allowing for sustained hypnagogic states. This website allows for a similar effect. Find a comfortable place to fall asleep and hold down one of the keys on your keyboard. When you fall asleep, you'll stop holding the key and a bell will play, waking you up.</p>
