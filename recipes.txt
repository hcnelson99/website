Spicy Black Bean Soup:

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 medium yellow onions, chopped
- 3 celery ribs, finely chopped
- 1 large carrot, peeled and sliced into thin rounds
- 6 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
- 4 1/2  teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 4 cans (15 ounces each) black beans, rinsed and drained
- 4 cups (32 ounces) low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
- 1 to 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, to taste, or 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional garnishes: diced avocado, extra cilantro, thinly sliced radishes, tortilla chips…



1. Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions, celery and carrot and a light sprinkle of salt.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetable are soft, about 10 to 15 minutes.

2. Stir in the garlic, cumin and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the beans and broth and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, until the broth is flavorful and the beans are very tender, about 30 minutes.

3. Transfer about 4 cups of the soup to a stand blender, securely fasten the lid, and blend until smooth (never fill your blender past the maximum fill line, and beware the steam that escapes from the top of the blender, it’s very hot). Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.

4. Return the pureed soup to the pot, stir in the cilantro, vinegar/lime juice and salt and pepper, to taste. Serve.

Eggplant Pasta

you will need: eggplant (1 for 1 or 2 servings; I use 2 when I make it for all of us); large white onions - 1 large to one eggplant, etc); box of chopped tomatoes (canned plum tomatoes if you can't find a box - look for low or no sodium if possible); olive oil, basil, salt & pepper; pasta - whatever shape you like; fresh mozzarella - I use a 1-pound package to 2 eggplant/onions - look for the pre-sliced "log" or the "pearls" to save you time on cutting it up

chop the onion, and heat a good amount of olive oil in a large skillet; sautee the onions on low-med heat while you prepare the eggplant

peel and dice the eggplant, and add to the onions - see if you need more oil, be liberal with the olive oil

cook the onion/eggplant mixture gently on low-ish heat, and stir often to keep from sticking. be patient with this step: cook until onions are very tender and look slippery and the eggplant is soft - it can take a while. heat a large pot of water for your pasta in the meanwhile. This is also an opportune time to open a nice bottle of red wine :-)

once the onion/eggplant looks nice and tender, add the tomatoes and plenty of basil - I probably use at least a tablespoon or more, and also some salt and pepper; raise heat until tomatoes are simmering, then lower heat and simmer a little while longer to allow the flavors to meld. Now you can probably cook your pasta (you don't want it to be done too soon, but if it is finished cooking before the eggplant/onion/tomato mixture, just stir a little olive oil in after you drain it, to keep it from sticking and put the lid on to keep it warm.) 

drain the pasta; turn off the heat under the vegetable mixture, and then stir in the little morsels of mozzarella - if you found the "pearls: then just add them; if not, then you would have cut the mozzarella into little bite-sized bits while the onion/eggplant was simmering. taste & adjust salt & pepper.
