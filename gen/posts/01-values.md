A few of my friends and I have recently done a simple exercise: write down our
top ten values.  You start from a list of almost four hundred and narrow down
to the ten that feel most important to you.

I found the process surprisingly clarifying. Having to pick out the concepts
that I value forced me to make fine distinctions between words with nearby
shades of meaning. The exercise was difficult and felt like a meaningful act of
self-expression.

My friend, after writing down his values, quit his job and moved across the
country. Writing down my values helped me much more confidently make a life
decision that challenged my sense of self.

Here are my top ten values (not in any particular order):

- Curiosity
- Creativity
- Passion
- Playfullness
- Humor
- Irreverence
- Decisiveness
- Meticulousness
- Perceptiveness
- Love

You don't have to do it now, but maybe when you're in a knot over a decision or
just feeling a bit contemplative, you can come back here and do the exercise.
Below is a list of 445 values. To narrow down, you can click the 'X' next to
each one to move it to the bottom of the list.
